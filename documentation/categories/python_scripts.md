Python Scripts is a part of the Home Assistant [`python_script` integration.](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/python_script/)

Python Scripts is **not** enabled by default in HACS (this follows default Home Assistant behavior).

## Enable Python Scripts in HACS

_There are 2 ways of doing this._

### Enable if you used the UI to configure HACS

Add a checkmark to the left of python_scripts in the UI configuration for HACS.

[For more about configuring HACS with the UI have a look here](configuration/basic.md)

### Enable if you used YAML to configure HACS

If you used YAML to configure HACS, add this under your HACS configuration to enable Python Scripts:

```yaml
hacs:
  ...
  python_script: true
```

After adding that you need to restart Home Assistant.

Any Python Script downloaded with HACS is stored in `python_scripts/` in your Home Assistant configuration directory.
