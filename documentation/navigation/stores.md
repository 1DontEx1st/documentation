This is where you can browse and install repositories.
For the "INTEGRATIONS", "PLUGINS", "APPDAEMON APPS", "PYTHON SCRIPTS" and "THEMES" tabs, the look and features are the same.

## Search

At the top of the page you have a searchbar, here you can search for repositories matching your criteria.

## New repositories

When new repositories are added to HACS, you will see them at the top of the store tabs, right below the searchbar.
If you open the [repository](/docs/navigation/repository) it will no longer be considered new. Alternatively, you can click the "CLEAR ALL NEW REPOSITORIES" button to clear the "new" flag from all repositories in that category.
