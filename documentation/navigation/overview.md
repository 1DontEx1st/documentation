This is the starting point you get to when you open HACS.

![nav_overview](/img/nav_overview.png)

Every tab you see here serves a separate purpose:

- [Installed](/docs/navigation/installed) This is where you get an overview of your installed repositories.
- [Stores (Integrations, plugins, appdaemon apps, python scripts, themes)](/docs/navigation/stores) This is where you can browse and install new repositories
- [Settings](/docs/navigation/settings) Settings and advanced features for HACS.


If you click on a repository under the installed or store tabs, you will get to the page of that [repository](/docs/navigation/repository).
